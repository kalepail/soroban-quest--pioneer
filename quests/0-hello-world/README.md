# Pioneer Quest - Hello World

This is the directory containing your actual quest that will need to be
completed. In this pioneer quest repo's version of this directory, you will find
so much commented useful stuff!

## README.md

You are currently reading this file, so you don't really need an explanation of
what it is... But, in the live quests, this file will contain instructions and
a task for what you must accomplish to successfully complete the quest. When
it's time to quest, this will be where you want to start.

## STORY.md

Did you know we also have a gripping, interesting, and captivating narrative to
go along with the Soroban quest!? Each quest will be accompanied by a fresh
episode of Bee's hunt for the golden abacus!

## Commented Examples

Inside the `src/` directory, you will find a well-documented version of the
"Hello World" example from the official [soroban-examples][examples] repository.
It will take you line-by-line through the contract that's been written, as well
as the tests.

We've taken a "rubber duck debugging" approach to explaining the inner workings
here, and it's made much of the contract writing conventions clearer, and make
more sense for a novice.
