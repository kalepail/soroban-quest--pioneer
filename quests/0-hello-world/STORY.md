# Prologue

Blossom Bernice Breydenblach carefully placed the bottle of universal solvent in
her backpack before zipping it up and reaching for the grappling hook. Roscoe
popped his head through the tent flap, eyes widening. "Good gracious, Bee. Are
you planning to pack the entire camp?"

"Unlikely adventures require unlikely tools, my friend," Bee said as she
finished looping the grappling hook and attaching it to the bag. "Riddles and
dangers aplenty await us in Squaktahune Temple, and it is best to be prepared!"

Roscoe stepped into the tent and proceeded to sprawl out in a nearby chair. "I
suppose it's prudent for one of us to be prepared for this quest," he said,
running a hand through his mop of hair (give him a break, a good barber was hard
to find in the Jordanian desert). "Why are we even seeking this Golden Abacus,
anyway?"

Bee glared pointedly at Roscoe. "You know why. The Golden Abacus, in the wrong
hands, will doom society for eternity. We are doing this for the good of
humankind."

"Oh, is that all," said Roscoe. "Let's get on with it then!" He stood up with a
flourish and lept from the tent.

Bee sighed. Yes, many challenges stood in their way, but once the Golden Abacus
was in their hands, they would be able to use it for so many wonderful things.
Bee tightened the laces on her boots and swung her pack onto her shoulders
before marching out into the thick, windswept sand. Roscoe fell into step beside
her holding just a water bottle and some duct tape.

Bee raised her eyebrow as Roscoe chuckled. "Just the essentials," he said with a
wink.

With these essentials in tow, Blossom Bernice Breydenblach and Roscoe hiked
toward Squaktahune Temple, the Golden Abacus, and adventure.
